# Converting---Handwritten-Documents-into-Digitized-Format
•	The stepwise approach of turning the manually written data into digitize data is as follows:  
  1.	Taking image as input for text extraction. 
  2.	The next step involves pre-processing of this text data. Feature extraction is performed to identify key information of an individual character.
  3.	These generated features are then used to extract text from the image
  3.	These generated features are then used to extract text from the image. 
•	The conversion of the captured text into an audio file is a prominient feature of this project. This feature is an example of application of AI for people with vision disability.

# FUTURE GOALS
•	To improve the project by adding pure feature of Machine Learning. This will be achieved by making a model that will be trained using an appropriate dataset, using a proper Machine Learning algorithm and implementing a neural network which will train the model for most accurate result. This will enhance the accuracy of identifying handwritten data by the model.
